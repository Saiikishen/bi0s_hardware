# AUTOMOTIVE SECURITY

## TASK DESCRIPTION:

Â Create a writeup on CAN network and its vulnerablities

## CAN Network:

- CAN (Controller Area Network) networks are widely used in various industries, including automotive, industrial automation, and medical devices

- Provides means of communication between electronic control units (ECUs) within a system



## VULNERABILITY:

- CAN networks are often physically accessible, making them vulnerable to unauthorized physical access. An attacker gaining physical access can tap into the network, inject malicious messages

- CAN networks typically lack built-in authentication and encryption mechanisms. Without proper authentication, any device can send messages to the network, making it difficult to verify the legitimacy of messages.

- The absence of encryption exposes the network to eavesdropping attacks

- CAN networks are susceptible to DoS (Denial of Service) attacks, where an attacker floods the network with a high volume of messages or manipulates network traffic to disrupt normal operations

- CAN networks have limited bandwidth compared to other network protocols. This limitation restricts the amount of data that can be transmitted, making them less suitable for applications with high data transfer requirements



## PROS:

- CAN networks are known for their simplicity and efficiency in transmitting messages between ECUs. They provide a cost-effective solution for interconnecting numerous devices in a system

- CAN networks excel in real-time communication, making them ideal for time-critical applications. They ensure timely delivery of messages with minimal latency, enabling precise coordination between ECUs

- Real-time capabilities make CAN networks suitable for applications that require high-speed data transmission and synchronization
